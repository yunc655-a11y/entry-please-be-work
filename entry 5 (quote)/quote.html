    <h1>Quotes I Reflect On</h1>
    <p class="note">Thoughts that stay with me.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Box 1 -->
  <div class="box">
    <img src="images/eric.jpg" alt="Eric quote" width="70%">
    <p class="quote">" I eventually learn that life reveals character, not promises.
It’s the friend who actually shows up to your dorm at 11pm with snacks
because she knows you’re stressed before finals... 
that’s the one with good character.
Someone who keeps their word even when it’s inconvenient.

Growing up feels like learning to see the difference
between people who sound nice
and people who are REALLY good."</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Box 2 -->
  <div class="box">
    <img src="images/jo.jpg" alt="Jo quote" width="70%">
    <p class="quote">" As one who suffer during covid and got over watching Jordan Peterson's quotes and motivaitonal videos. In your 20s, every choice has a cost.
If you grind all semester, you sacrifice free time.
If you skip that opportunity because you're scared,
you pay the price later with regret.

Choosing a toxic relationship?
You pay with your peace.
Choosing to walk away?
You pay with loneliness for a while.

There’s no path without a price —
so the real question becomes:
Is the price worth who I’m becoming? By the way, I love Jordan peterson..."</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Box 3 -->
  <div class="box">
    <img src="images/mel.jpg" alt="Mel quote" width="70%">
    <p class="quote">" This is so true... Sometimes in college I think,
“I’ll start the gym next month,”
“I’ll fix my sleep later, but months pass fast.
A whole year can disappear into procrastination disguised as “self-care.”

I don’t need to feel ready to begin ...
I ust need to begin badly. 

Even a 10-minute walk,
one page of reading,
one cold  email,
one small boundary you kept…

Those tiny inconveniences build a different version of you.
A year from now, I ll be grateful that I did the things I didn’t want to do.”"</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Box 4 -->
  <div class="box">
    <img src="images/zig.jpg" alt="Zig quote" width="70%">
    <p class="quote">"Motivation isn’t supposed to last.
It’s like showering  
I don’t complain that I need to do it again,
I just… do it again... "</p>
